## About the Project

This project aims to provide interactive visualizations for various calculus concepts, including derivatives, integrals, differential equations, and optimization problems. Each Jupyter notebook in this repository focuses on a specific concept, providing explanations, Python implementations, and interactive elements to enhance your understanding of calculus.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Calculus-Visualizations.git
cd Calculus-Visualizations
```
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll need Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, and Matplotlib to run the interactive notebooks. If you haven't installed these libraries, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

- [Integrals](#integrals)
- [Differential Equations](#diffeq)
- [Optimization](#optim)

## Usage

1) Navigate to the specific concept folder you're interested in (e.g., Derivatives).
2) Open the corresponding Jupyter notebook (e.g., Derivatives.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook.
3) Run the cells in the notebook to see interactive visualizations and explore calculus concepts.
